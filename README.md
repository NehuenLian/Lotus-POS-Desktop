**Lotus POS** is a desktop Point of Sale system designed for small and medium-sized businesses, with a built-in module for electronic fiscal invoicing compliant with Argentinian regulations (AFIP/ARCA). It allows you to manage sales, inventory, pricing, and database configuration in a simple way, while also handling the complexities of fiscal integration.

## Main Features

- **Sales Management:** Fast sales registration, product selection by barcode, automatic total calculation, and payment method selection.
- **Inventory Control:** Instant stock lookup by product.
- **Price Management:** Search and update product prices.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Change the database URL from the interface and restart the app to apply changes.
- **Architecture:** Clear separation between business logic, data access, controllers, and views.
- **Logging:** Log management for auditing and debugging.
- **Fiscal Integration (AFIP/ARCA):**
    - Generates electronic invoices (CAE).
    - Handles communication with AFIP web services using SOAP.
    - Manages authentication tokens (TA) and their validity.
    - Signs requests using a digital certificate and private key.
    - Builds and validates XML requests and responses.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core language.
- **PySide6**: For the desktop GUI.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interaction (ORM).
- **Zeep & lxml**: For SOAP client and XML processing for fiscal integration.
- **python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **OpenSSL**: Used via command line for cryptographic operations.
- **tenacity**: For retry logic on web requests.
- **ntplib**: For time synchronization, critical for token generation.

## Project Structure

The project has a modular architecture, separating the core POS application from the fiscal integration service.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NehuenLian/Lotus-POS-Fiscal-Integration
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values. This includes the database URL and paths for the fiscal integration certificates and other parameters.
     ```
     # .env file
     DB_URL="sqlite:///src/data_access/sample_database.db"
     
     # Paths for AFIP integration
     CERT_PATH="service/certificates/your_cert.crt"
     PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="service/certificates/your_private_key.key"
     WSDL_URL_WSAA="https://wsaahomo.afip.gov.ar/ws/services/LoginCms?wsdl"
     WSDL_URL_WSFE="https://wswhomo.afip.gov.ar/wsfev1/service.asmx?WSDL"
     # ... and other variables from .env.example
     ```
